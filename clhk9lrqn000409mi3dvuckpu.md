There has been an increasing popularity of Dark Mode in the past few years, and you may have noticed it yourself. In this tutorial, I'll provide a step-by-step guide to adding a Dark Mode toggle to your website using **Next.js** and **ChakraUI**. This toggle can be easily implemented on any of your websites in order to create an enhanced user experience for your visitors.

# An overview

Let's begin by getting an overview of the tech stack that we will use to carry on with this project.

## What is React?

**React** is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library developed by **Facebook.** It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications based on components quickly and efficiently. To find out more, check out the [React documentation](https://react.dev/).

## What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a **React** framework that gives us the building blocks to create web applications.

By framework, it means Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application. To find out more, check out [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/).

## What is Chakra UI?

**Chakra UI** is a simple, modular, and accessible component library. It's made up of basic building blocks that can help you build the User Interface (UI) of the front end of your web application.

Chakra UI comes with built-in support for managing color modes in your apps easily. Chakra's components are dark mode compatible by default. In some scenarios, you might need to make your components respond to color mode.

To learn more, check out the [Chakra UI documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/).

# Let's Build Our Project.

Now, let's look at the prerequisites needed to develop our project.

### Requirements

* [Node.js 16.8.0](https://nodejs.org/) or newer
    
* MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.
    

### Create a Next.js app

Let's use `create-next-app` to build a new Next.js app, which will automatically set up all of our app's dependencies and modules.

Head over to your terminal and type the following.

```bash
npx create-next-app dark-light-mode-toggle

cd dark-light-mode-toggle

npm run dev
```

*dark-light-mode-toggle* is the name of the project, you can keep any at your convenience.

This command will create a new Next.js app and now head over to the development server on port 3000 to see your app live in action.

You would be able to see this page on your local host port.

### Install Chakra

Let's now install Chakra in our app *dark-light-mode-toggle*. Head over to the terminal and add this command.

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root of your application. This can be either in your `index.js`, `pages/_app.js` or `App.js` depending on the framework you use.

### Setting up Chakra UI with Next.js

So, for our `next.js` app, we have `_app.js` in the `pages` folder where we would include our `ChakraProvider`.

Head over to `pages/_app.js` (create it if it doesn't exist) and wrap the `Component` with the `ChakraProvider`:

```javascript
import '../styles/globals.css'
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

Now, go to your [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) port and you will see a slight difference in the background color of the homepage.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683198370612/03f6cee5-5cc7-4a81-8d73-3a2df0db5f16.png align="center")

What happens here is, when you set up Chakra Provider, Chakra UI sets the color of your app according to your system preferences i.e. If your browser has dark mode enabled, it will set the dark color palette for your app and vice versa.

However, we can customize the theme of our app, we will see this in the next section of this article.

### Updating the Chakra UI theme config

Chakra UI provides an `extendTheme` function that deep merges the default theme with your customizations.

Let's create a `theme.js` file in the root of our project or if we want we could directly include our theme configuration in `_app.js`.

```javascript
/// theme.js

// 1. import `extendTheme` function
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react";

// 2. Add your color mode config
const config = {
  initialColorMode: "light",
  useSystemColorMode: false,
};

// 3. extend the theme
const theme = extendTheme({ config });

export default theme;
```

Here we have created our config which sets up the initial color mode of our app to `light`. The theme config for color mode has 2 options:

* `initialColorMode`: The initial mode you'd like your app to start with when a user visits the page for the first time. The value can be one of `dark`, `light` or `system`. The default value is `light`.
    
* `useSystemColorMode`: If `true`, Chakra UI subscribes to changes in `system` color mode. If set to `false`, the app's color mode is detached from the `system` color mode.
    

Now pass this theme config as a prop to the `ChakraProvider` that we initially set up in our `_app.js`.

```javascript
import '../styles/globals.css'
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import theme from '../theme' 

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

### Let's create a toggle button component

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683712442371/650ee237-9360-4797-9e08-c7a9cbfc7212.png align="center")

Create a new folder `component` and a file `ToggleButton.js` in it. To create a toggle-switching button using the icon, you can import icons from any icons library. Let's use `react-icons` to import toggle button icons (`BsSun` for light mode and `BsMoon` for dark mode).

Install `react-icons` in your project using `npm i react-icons`.

The code for the toggle component would look like these.

```javascript
//Toggle.js

import {
  VStack,
  IconButton,
  useColorMode,
  useColorModeValue,
  Heading,
} from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { BsSun, BsMoon } from "react-icons/bs";

function Toggle() {
  // Chakra UI hook that toggle the color mode
  const { toggleColorMode } = useColorMode();
  return (
    <VStack>
      {useColorModeValue(
        <Heading>Light Mode</Heading>,
        <Heading>Dark Mode</Heading>
      )}
      <IconButton
        aria-label="Mode Change"
        variant="outline"
        colorScheme="black"
        size="lg"
        icon={useColorModeValue(<BsMoon />, <BsSun />)}
        onClick={toggleColorMode}
      />
    </VStack>
  );
}

export default Toggle;
```

Now import this `Toggle` component wherever you want to display your toggle button in your app. I have imported this into the index.js file for now.

**How mode toggle work?**  
Chakra UI uses `useColorMode` that is a React hook that gives you access to the current color mode, and a function to toggle the color mode as we have done here when we click on our button, it toggles the color mode and the icon for the respective modes.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1683714760612/9474287a-c601-494b-b458-0e9954c940dc.png align="center")

You can customize your toggle button according to your style.

### Customize any Component/Element styling using `useColorModeValue`

Chakra UI provides a react hook `useColorModeValue` to change any value or style based on the color mode.  
It takes 2 arguments: *the value in light mode*, *and the value in dark mode*.

For example - if you want to change the background color of a Box from grey in dark mode to white in light mode, the following is the code.

```javascript
<Box bgColor={useColorModeValue("white", "grey")}></Box>
```

So, that sums up how you can add a dark mode toggle to your **Next.js** application using **Chakra UI**.
