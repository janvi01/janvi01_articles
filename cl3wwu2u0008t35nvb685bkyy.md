Hello everyone, Thanks for dropping by!

I am **Janvi Bajoria**, an Outreachy intern. I am a second-year engineering undergraduate student hailing from India. My interest usually lies in frontend development and contributing to open source.

I have been accepted as an Outreachy intern for May to August 2022 round. I'm interning for Firefox Project "**Firefox Picture-in-Picture Improvements**" under the guidance of my mentor **kpatenio** and **Niklas Baumgardner**. I am looking forward to having a great experience this summer.

Youâ€™d usually find me listening to music, watching series, or scrolling Twitter in my spare time. I am a music lover and play a ukulele instrument (not much good :p). Sometimes you can find me doing artwork and sketching.

### What is Outreachy?
Outreachy provides three-month internships for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech. Interns are paid a stipend of $7,000. Both interns and mentors work remotely. This program is conducted twice a year. You can get more information about this program [here](https://www.outreachy.org/).

### How did I apply for it?
I got to know about Outreachy from my brother who is a software engineer. Again, I heard about it from my seniors during college events. Ever since I came to know about Outreachy, I wanted to participate in it.

Last year I applied for Outreachy, unfortunately, my initial application couldn't get accepted due to time commitments. I looked for organizations that matches my skill. I selected two organizations to contribute to. Mozilla Firefox was my first priority as it is such a huge software and contributing to it is an achievement in itself. This year, even before the applications started, I started contributing to the project and asking relevant doubts on their community channel.  I found everyone to be quite welcoming and helpful. I loved the whole community and how everyone helps each other.
This was my first time contributing to such a huge software **Mozilla Firefox**. I was just trying to give my best without thinking about the end results. I submitted my final proposal before the deadline.

Finally, on 20th May 2022, the results were announced, and Tadaa ðŸŽ‰ I was selected as an intern. I was on top of the moon. I would like to thank the whole community and my mentors kpatenio and Niklas for being so supportive every time.


## My core values are:

- **Curiosity** - I value curiosity, the desire to learn or know about what interests me drives me to achieve my goal.
- **Growth** - I think investing a considerable amount of time and energy in one's personal development is needed for one's growth.
- **Compassion** - I value compassion, it drives our commitment to serve others with empathy and respect.
