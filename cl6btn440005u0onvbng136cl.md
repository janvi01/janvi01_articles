Hello everyone, Thanks for dropping by!

Welcome to the fifth blog of my outreachy series. This blog is all about my **career goals**, **aims** and **aspirations**.

It's been nine weeks since my outreachy internship started and the journey has been phenomenal so far. I can't believe time flew away this fast!  I remember the day when I got the acceptance mail, I was on top of the Moon.<br/> My internship at **Firefox** has helped me build my self-confidence and evolve me into a more passionate human towards my work and career.

From the very beginning, I was kind of interested in technology and computers which led me to choose Software Engineering as my career. From knowing the basics of programming language during High School to have a curiosity about how the software works, and what it takes to build a brand new website from scratch. These thoughts have helped me to decide what career I wanna pursue. 
During high school, I learned the basics of HTML, C++, and JAVA. At that time, I had no idea how vast the Computer Science field is and What other domains are there inside it.

## About Me

I am **Janvi Bajoria**, an undergraduate student from India. I am currently doing my Outreachy Internship working with **Mozilla** on one of their **Firefox** products i.e. **[Picture-in-Picture](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-picture-picture-firefox)**. I have merged 10+ patches to the Mozilla source code and added features to Picture-in-Picture which is live in the [Firefox browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

I am into tech since last year which started by putting my hands on Web development, and Design, gradually into competitive programming, and then contributing to Open Source.

Since high school, I was fascinated with websites and eager to create one on my own. While starting my university, I started learning web development from different free sources like [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), etc. 
My first ever website which I created last year was the Food Price Calculator Website of a cafe. I didn't have any idea about Github at that time. I just created a repo and deployed my page using Github pages while watching a youtube tutorial :D.
Here's the repo [link](https://github.com/janvi01/priceCalc) and the page [link](https://janvi01.github.io/priceCalc/). 
Then I joined the technical club of my college where we were given the task to make simple JavaScript projects like calculators, e-commerce apps, etc. I made a Music player website and implemented its functionality using JavaScript. Here's the repo [link](https://github.com/janvi01/Musicplayer) and page's [link](https://janvi01.github.io/Musicplayer/).
This was something that interested me and made me deep dive into Frontend Development, JavaScript, and its various frameworks.
I have made several projects using React and also have a bit of idea about how the backend works. 



Contributing to Open source is also one of the things which I am passionate about. I started my open source journey by contributing to small projects and participating in programs like **[GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSOC)](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/)**, **[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)**, etc. I got to know about GSSOC from my seniors. It is a 3-month duration program where participants contribute to different projects based on their skills. I was a newbie to open source at that time. I somehow managed to get [9 PRs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RjdpcZe8XPz-1bbL-yqDJoB2XqGNJPlHEu_dGLgCzTA/edit?usp=sharing) merged and contributed to three projects during that program.
This program helps me to get familiar with git and GitHub, taught me how to contribute, and eventually helped me to give my best during the contribution period of Outreachy and getting selected as an Intern. Tadaa! ðŸ¥³

Before Outreachy, I didn't have experience contributing to Large Scale projects. Contributing to **Firefox**, a free open source browser that millions of users use is an achievement in itself for me.

## Skills & Interests

My interest lies in Front-end development. I am proficient in JavaScript and React.
I have made several projects, full-fledged websites, and web apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Firebase. I am also comfortable with using Figma as I have made several, banners, posters, and mockup UIs for different events at my college.

I am proficient in C++ and somewhat comfortable with python. I have got my hands on Competitive programming by giving contests on different online judges platforms.
[Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/janvi1509) , [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/janvi01/)

I am proactive and efficient at time management. I feel I am a quick learner, curious, and pick up new tech stacks easily.

## Next Step

Recently, I guess I have developed an interest in Blogging and technical writing. I am continuously trying to improve my writing skills and looking forward to taking it further.
I would love to explore the Backend development and Design domain more in the future.
I would continue contributing to Free Open Source Software as this is something that I love and helps me to gain real-world experience. 

After this Internship, I will be looking for part-time roles and internships based on my skills.
I am open to work and comfortable with working remotely as I have adapted it well during my 3-months Outreachy internship at **Firefox**. It will be great if you could share opportunities where you think I would be a good fit. Feel free to reach out if thereâ€™s anything you think I could help you out with.
